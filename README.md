# ZUSCH

This is my Final Project for the Taktsoft Campus Talents Fullstack Developer Bootcamp, Eichhoernchen Group 01-05.2025.

Zusch is an app that makes it easy to give away items you no longer need, or find items that you do need! The name of the app comes from an abbreviation of the German "zu verschenken".

No lengthy back-and-forth, no hassle, no fuss, _einfach zuschen_!

## Giving

Users can post a box on a map and create a list of its contents. They can remove items from the list that they notice have been taken. They can see when all items have been taken from their box.

## Seeking

Seekers can also find other users' boxes and their items on the map, and come by to take a look!
Users can cross out items from the box's item list if they take an item, or if they notice someone else already took an item.
