#ZUSCH

This is my Final Project for the Taktsoft Campus Talents Fullstack Developer Bootcamp, Eichhoernchen Group 01-05.2025.

Zusch is an app that makes it easy to give away items you no longer need, or find items that you do need!

Givers post a box on a map and create a list of its contents.
Seekers can find boxes and their items on the map, and come by to take a look!
Users can cross out items from the boxes if they take an item, or if they notice someone else already took an item.

No lengthy back-and-forth, no hassle, no fuss, einfach zuschen!
